# Game-Store
This is a group project which I did together with my team-mates from school.
It is a shopping cart web app created using .NET Core MVC Entity Framework.

It has following features:
1. Log In/Log Out Function for users (users need to log in to make a purchase)
2. Product page
3. Product Details page where users can see game details with a trailer video
4. Shopping Cart
5. Purchase History where users can see all their past purchases with an activation code for each purchase unique to each user/each game.
